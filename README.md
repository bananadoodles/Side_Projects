This goal of this project was to classify images on being a seal or a dachshund using CNN and TensorFlow.\
I used transfer learning by utilizing Google's MobileNetV2 model available in TensorFlow Hub. There were some awesome YouTube walkthroughs!
Overall, the model performed amazingly (very scientific term) on test images it had never seen before. (My two dogs being some of the test subjects!)
