This goal of this project was to classify images on being a seal or a dachshund using CNN and TensorFlow.\
I used transfer learning by utilizing Google's MobileNetV2 model available in TensorFlow Hub. There were some awesome YouTube walkthroughs!
Overall, the model performed at a 97.50% accuracy on the test set and 100% accuracy on my own two dogs!
